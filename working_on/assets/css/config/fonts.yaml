# Font - Families
#
# The font families used throughout the site, feel free to rename them to
# the fonts that are used i.e. $Font_Family-Myriad|Minion instead of
# Serif|SansSerif.
#
# Also don't worry about making this a map as you end up with very long lines
# having to do map-get($Font_Families, name) we also tend to have very few so
# a map tends to be overkill.
families:
  sans: "'Helvetica Neue', 'Helvetica', 'Arial', sans-serif"
  serif: "'Georgia', 'Times New Roman', serif"

# Font - Sizes
#
# Font sizes used across the site, wysiwyg specific sizes are namespaced with
# wys- to make it clear these are the sizings that are choosable in the
# wysiwyg. For sizes just used on the site use a non namespaced name
#
# !!! Make sure the keys match the keys in the equivalent line-height map
